# Image-Upload
An Image Upload Application.

Built in PHP, this allows you to login and out and upload images, applying responsiveness automatically in a Masonry Gallery format with jQuery.

Some features I'm looking to add include a create account option and delete images. Additionally I would like to change some of the styling for a more sllek and improved desing/layout.

Configuration settings are placed in a JSON file outside the root folder.
